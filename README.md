# FolderCleaner
A program for cleaning out a specific folder based on file-size, and files selected.

Requires the Shell module from the Windows API Codepack to function, located here:

This is just a project I undertook for the sake of learning more about C#, as well as building a portfolio for job stuffs.
It should work as-is, and I'm positive there are much better programs out there that do what this one does.

This will continue to be worked on and improved over time, as I use this to learn more and more about my craft.
